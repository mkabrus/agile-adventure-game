        // EXPANDED QUESTION BANK to 30 questions
        const allQuestions = [
            // Original 15
            { question: "A Product Owner is struggling to keep up with stakeholder demands and feels like a bottleneck. The most effective solution according to the Scrum Guide is...", options: ["For the Scrum Master to act as a proxy for the PO", "For the organization to respect the PO's decisions and authority", "To form a committee to help the PO prioritize", "To create a rigid, long-term plan to prevent changes"], answer: 1, explanation: "The Scrum Guide states, 'For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions.' The LinkedIn posts highlight that POs often fail when they lack true authority and are treated like proxies." },
            { question: "A team's Sprint Goal is 'Complete user stories 1-8.' What does this common mistake indicate?", options: ["The team is highly focused on value", "The team is using the Sprint Goal as a to-do list instead of an objective", "The team has a strong understanding of the Product Goal", "The team is correctly following the Scrum Guide"], answer: 1, explanation: "A Sprint Goal should be a single, valuable objective, not a to-do list. The goal 'Enable customers to purchase products seamlessly' allows for flexibility, while 'Complete stories 1-8' is just a task list, as highlighted in the 'Sprint Goal Revolution' post." },
            { question: "What is the primary purpose of the Daily Scrum?", options: ["To give a detailed status report to the Scrum Master", "To inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the plan for the day", "To solve complex technical problems in a group setting", "To re-plan the entire Sprint from scratch"], answer: 1, explanation: "Per the Scrum Guide, the purpose is to 'inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary.' It's a 15-minute event for the Developers, not a status meeting." },
            { question: "The Scrum Guide states a 'self-managing' team decides 'who does what, when, and how.' What common misconception often undermines this?", options: ["That self-management requires more structure and clear boundaries", "That 'self-managing' means the team has no accountability and can do whatever they want", "That the Product Owner assigns all the tasks to the team", "That the Scrum Master must approve the team's plan"], answer: 1, explanation: "The 'Self-Management Misconception' post points out that leaders often think 'self-managing' means 'hands-off,' and teams think it means 'no accountability.' Both are wrong. It requires clear boundaries like the Sprint Goal and DoD." },
            { question: "The commitment for the Product Backlog is the Product Goal. What is the commitment for the Increment?", options: ["The Sprint Goal", "Velocity", "The Definition of Done", "Stakeholder approval"], answer: 2, explanation: "The Definition of Done is the formal commitment for the Increment. It ensures everyone has a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete and of releasable quality." },
            { question: "A team's retrospective consists only of 'What went well, what didn't.' The most crucial missing piece is...", options: ["Making sure every person speaks for five minutes", "Creating a specific and actionable plan for improvement", "Inviting senior management to observe", "Celebrating the things that went well"], answer: 1, explanation: "The Scrum Guide states the purpose is 'to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.' The 'Retrospective That Actually Works' post emphasizes that a retrospective fails if it doesn't result in a concrete plan for change." },
            { question: "According to the 2020 Scrum Guide, who is accountable for the Scrum Team's effectiveness?", options: ["The Product Owner", "The Scrum Master", "The Developers", "A project manager"], answer: 1, explanation: "The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team's effectiveness. They achieve this by enabling the team to improve its practices within the Scrum framework." },
            { question: "What is the 'transparency paradox' described in the provided texts?", options: ["That perfect transparency is impossible to achieve", "That sharing too much unrefined information can create chaos instead of clarity", "That stakeholders don't really want transparency", "That transparency is only for the Developers"], answer: 1, explanation: "The 'Transparency Paradox' post argues that 'radical transparency' can lead to information overload. True transparency, enabled by things like a clear Sprint Goal and Definition of Done, creates clarity, not chaos." },
            { question: "What is the primary risk of having a weak or vague Definition of Done?", options: ["The team might work too slowly", "The Sprint might be cancelled", "The Increment delivered may not be usable or of sufficient quality", "The Scrum Master will have to write more documentation"], answer: 2, explanation: "A weak DoD (e.g., 'code is written') fails to ensure quality. A strong DoD ensures the Increment is truly usable and releasable, preventing technical debt and quality problems, as per the 'Definition of Done Dilemma' post." },
            { question: "Who has the authority to cancel a Sprint?", options: ["The Developers, if the work is too hard", "The Scrum Master, if the team is not following the rules", "The stakeholders, if they change their minds", "The Product Owner, if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete"], answer: 3, explanation: "The 2020 Scrum Guide states this clearly: 'Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.'" },
            { question: "A Product Backlog is a living artifact. The 'Product Backlog Evolution' post suggests a healthy backlog is one that...", options: ["Has over 200 detailed items planned for the next year", "Never changes once the priorities are set", "Is constantly evolving, with old items being removed and new ones emerging", "Is managed and updated exclusively by the Scrum Master"], answer: 2, explanation: "A static backlog is a sign of trouble. A healthy backlog is 'emergent,' meaning it constantly changes based on learning and feedback. Old, irrelevant items should be pruned." },
            { question: "What are the five Scrum Values?", options: ["Speed, Quality, Cost, Scope, Risk", "Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage", "Planning, Executing, Inspecting, Adapting, Delivering", "Honesty, Trust, Leadership, Collaboration, and Innovation"], answer: 1, explanation: "The five Scrum Values are Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage. These values are the foundation upon which trust and empiricism are built." },
            { question: "Your team is 'cross-functional' because it has developers and testers. However, developers only code and testers only test. What is this an example of?", options: ["A truly cross-functional team", "Co-located functional silos", "A self-organizing team", "A mature Scrum team"], answer: 1, explanation: "The 'Cross-Functional Reality Check' post clarifies this. True cross-functionality means the team as a whole has all the skills and collaborates to achieve the Sprint Goal, rather than individuals working in silos within the team." },
            { question: "The purpose of the Sprint Review is to...", options: ["Get formal sign-off on the work completed", "Inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations", "Give a status update to senior leadership", "Hold the team accountable for velocity metrics"], answer: 1, explanation: "The Sprint Review is a working session to 'inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations' with stakeholders. It's a collaboration and feedback event, not just a demo or sign-off meeting." },
            { question: "An organization is struggling with its Agile transformation. According to the 'Agile Transformation Trap', they are likely focusing on...", options: ["Individuals and interactions over processes and tools", "Processes and tools over individuals and interactions", "Hiring more Scrum Masters", "Reducing the number of meetings"], answer: 1, explanation: "The trap is focusing on the right side of the Agile Manifesto values (processes, tools, documentation) instead of the left side (individuals, interactions, working software). An Agile transformation is a mindset shift first." },
            
            // New 15
            { question: "A manager wants to compare Team A's velocity (30 points) with Team B's (45 points) to measure productivity. What is the most accurate response?", options: ["Team B is 50% more productive than Team A.", "This is a good way to measure performance.", "Velocity is a team-specific metric for forecasting and cannot be used to compare teams.", "Ask Team A to increase their velocity to 45 points."], answer: 2, explanation: "The 'Velocity Trap' post highlights that velocity measures effort, not value, and is team-specific. Using it to compare teams is a common anti-pattern that leads to undesirable behavior." },
            { question: "A team is working without overtime but a manager says they aren't being 'challenged'. A sustainable pace means...", options: ["A comfortable pace where the team is never stressed.", "A constant pace that can be maintained indefinitely while managing quality.", "Working at maximum capacity, including overtime.", "Lowering the Sprint commitment to reduce pressure."], answer: 1, explanation: "Sustainable pace, per the Agile Manifesto, is about maintaining a constant, indefinite pace. This is enabled by good practices like managing technical debt and clear goals, not just avoiding hard work." },
            { question: "The team repeatedly reports 'waiting for stakeholder approval' as an impediment. A good Scrum Master should...", options: ["Tell the team to wait patiently.", "Log the impediment and report it to management.", "Investigate the root cause, such as a lack of trust or unclear decision-making authority.", "Immediately escalate the issue to the stakeholder's manager."], answer: 2, explanation: "Surface-level impediments often hide deeper, systemic issues. A Scrum Master's job is to 'cause the removal' by digging deeper to find the root cause, like a lack of trust or centralized control." },
            { question: "To shorten feedback loops and accelerate learning, a team should prioritize...", options: ["Holding longer Sprint Retrospectives.", "Writing more comprehensive documentation.", "Getting feedback from real users on working software as frequently as possible.", "Waiting until the project's end for a single, major review."], answer: 2, explanation: "The 'Feedback Loop Revolution' post emphasizes that the goal is to reduce the time it takes to get real feedback. The most valuable feedback comes from customers using working software." },
            { question: "The Product Owner is hesitant to address technical debt. The best way for Developers to get buy-in is to...", options: ["Refuse to work on new features.", "Translate the technical debt into its business impact, such as slower delivery.", "Work on the technical debt secretly without telling the PO.", "Insist that technical debt is a development problem only."], answer: 1, explanation: "The 'Technical Debt Time Bomb' post argues that tech debt is a business problem. To get buy-in, Developers must frame it in terms of business impact, like how it slows down future feature delivery." },
            { question: "The three pillars of empiricism, upon which Scrum is founded, are:", options: ["Planning, Execution, and Delivery.", "Transparency, Inspection, and Adaptation.", "Communication, Collaboration, and Celebration.", "Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers."], answer: 1, explanation: "The 2020 Scrum Guide explicitly states, 'Scrum is founded on empiricism... These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.'" },
            { question: "Sprint Planning now begins with a key topic according to the 2020 Scrum Guide. What is it?", options: ["Topic One: How will the work get done?", "Topic One: What can be Done this Sprint?", "Topic One: Why is this Sprint valuable?", "Topic One: Who is available to work?"], answer: 2, explanation: "Sprint Planning now starts with the 'Why', where the team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal. This provides purpose before diving into the 'What' (selecting items) and the 'How' (the plan)." },
            { question: "The Product Goal is best described as...", options: ["A detailed list of all features for the next release.", "A long-term objective for the Scrum Team describing a future state of the product.", "A contract with stakeholders that cannot be changed.", "The same thing as the Sprint Goal."], answer: 1, explanation: "The Scrum Guide defines the Product Goal as a 'future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against.' It is a long-term objective." },
            { question: "A sign that a Scrum Master is evolving to serve the wider organization is when they...", options: ["Become an expert at facilitating all the team's meetings.", "Focus on addressing systemic impediments and coaching leadership on agility.", "Know the status of every single task in the Sprint Backlog.", "Create all the user stories for the team."], answer: 1, explanation: "The 'Scrum Master Evolution' post shows a maturity model where advanced Scrum Masters move from team-level coaching to tackling organizational impediments and coaching leadership." },
            { question: "A team has a very strict 'Definition of Ready' checklist. This common pattern can lead to...", options: ["Higher quality work.", "Faster delivery.", "A rigid backlog and resistance to change, hindering agility.", "Better collaboration with the Product Owner."], answer: 2, explanation: "While not a formal part of Scrum, a rigid 'DoR' is a common pattern that can undermine the Agile value of 'welcoming changing requirements' by creating gates and resisting flexibility." },
            { question: "A key goal of the Sprint Review is to foster collaboration. A poor way to do this is to...", options: ["Treat it as a working session to discuss what to do next.", "Adjust the Product Backlog based on feedback.", "Limit it to a one-way presentation with no discussion.", "Discuss progress toward the Product Goal with stakeholders."], answer: 2, explanation: "The Sprint Review should be a working session for collaboration, not a one-way presentation. Its purpose is to inspect the outcome and adapt." },
            { question: "Who is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint?", options: ["The Developers.", "The Product Owner.", "The Scrum Master.", "The entire Scrum Team."], answer: 3, explanation: "The 2020 Scrum Guide states, 'The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint.' It is a collective accountability." },
            { question: "The Product Owner is accountable for effective Product Backlog management. This includes...", options: ["Writing code for the most important items.", "Forcing the Developers to accept a certain number of items.", "Developing the Product Goal and ordering Product Backlog items.", "Facilitating the Daily Scrum."], answer: 2, explanation: "The Scrum Guide lists the PO's accountabilities, which include developing and communicating the Product Goal, creating and communicating PBIs, and ordering those items to maximize value." },
            { question: "What is the timebox for Sprint Planning for a one-month Sprint?", options: ["Maximum of four hours.", "Maximum of eight hours.", "As long as it takes.", "Exactly two hours."], answer: 1, explanation: "The Scrum Guide specifies the timeboxes for all events. For a one-month Sprint, Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours." },
            { question: "Can a Scrum Team deliver an Increment to stakeholders before the Sprint Review?", options: ["No, all work must be held until the Sprint Review.", "Yes, the Sprint Review should never be a gate to releasing value.", "Only if the Scrum Master gives permission.", "Only if the Sprint is cancelled."], answer: 1, explanation: "The Scrum Guide explicitly states, 'an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.'" }
